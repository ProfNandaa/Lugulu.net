#Lugulu.net#

##About the Project##
Ths is an old project I had started, was creating an interactive platform for my village (Lugulu, KE).

Currently, I'm looking for contributors to revamp this project, focusing a pseudo-social network for African villages.
Call it vijiji.io :)

If interested to discuss this, drop me a line on prof[at]nandaa.com
